            <b>Atomic Habits by James Clear</b>

            <p>
                The Atomic Habits is a fantastic book for anyone looking for ways to improve their lives. For me, it's a
                spectacular and incredibly amazing book that clearly conveys how atomic, or minute, modifications to
                one's daily routine can lead to unimaginable long-term outcomes.

                This book greatly aided me in understanding my personal habits, clearing my mind, and paving the road
                for me to develop new habits and abandon old ones. I've realised that when something is difficult or
                appears to be impossible, I have a tendency to give up. However, after reading this book, I felt
                compelled to keep working on the issues that I'm having trouble with.

                The entire point of the book is to make individuals aware of the need of making a 1% improvement every
                day with patience and consistency.

                The author explains how to build healthy habits and break negative ones. Reading the biographies of
                prominent people and learning how they got started and maintained their careers was both motivating and
                fascinating.

                In his book, the author simply explains how human behavior works. We normally notice something - cue, we
                then want it - craving, and we then get it - response, which makes us happy - reward. So he devised a
                system for forming healthy habits and breaking negative ones that focuses on each step of the cycle,
                which he refers to as laws.
