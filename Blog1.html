            <b>How cycling took me from fat to fit in 8 months</b>

            <p>Like any other average person, fitness and exercising were never my cup of tea. But, as COVID19 struck, many people began eating healthy and exercising on a regular basis. I fit into this category.  I was always a lazy person, who joined the gym for few months and left. But this pandemic gave me a reality check and got me motivated to get fit and lose a few kilograms.
            </p>
            <p>At first, I borrowed a friend’s cycle and began going for short evening rounds with my neighbor. In a month’s time, I felt pretty confident riding a bicycle, and after some research and reviewing, I got my very own geared bicycle. Soon, cycling became a part of my daily activities. As the days went by, my stamina kept building and so did the distance of my rides. Along with exercising, I’ve also discovered many scenic, peaceful and calm places in the interior villages of my state - Goa. I also made it a point to go cycling to the beach once a week and have a short walk there. For me, cycling feels more like a stress buster and a fun activity to do.
            </p>

            <p>
            In a span of 8 months, my weight reduced from 86kgs to 76kgs, and I could feel the difference. My clothes which once upon a time fit, now felt oversized. Prior to getting into cycling, I would experience severe headaches quite often, but now that has disappeared. I feel more confident, physically and mentally as compared to when I was overweight. 
        </p>

        <p>
                I would personally recommend cycling to anyone who feels exercising is stressful and strenuous. Cycling can help one burn calories without much wear and tear on your body, like running which is more stressful on your knees.

                Having worked as a certified fitness trainer for 21 years, I’ve long since come to the conclusion that if you’re looking for the best exercise to shed a few pounds—and keep them off—nothing beats cycling.
