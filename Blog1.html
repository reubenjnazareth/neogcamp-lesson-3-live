            <p>
                It all started in February 2020 when the stock markets began falling globally. This fall went on until the first week of April. I remember a friend of mine mentioning to me that the stock market had crashed, I still remember him saying that his profits of two years have been wiped out. This sudden fall in the market got me curious to know how it all works. I began reading various articles on the internet, watching several youtube videos, etc.. During those days, I happened to stumble on this book named “Rich Dad Poor Dad” by Robert Kyosaki. By far, this has been one of the best books I have ever read. I would totally recommend this book to anyone, especially kids in their teens. This book has changed my perspective about wealth.
